Since then I havestrived to improve it, and since the GS came out, have been longing toput my program in the Mouse/Windows based environment.  In doing so I have1) Written the entire thing in 65816 Assembly (hence the name -816)2) At least doubled the speed at which it "Life-ifies"3) Almost doubled the available "Universe" area to work in (thus negating   the speed effects, though it still runs at the good clip of two generations   per second)    The actual code to do life was stripped out of my earlier version ofLife, although I optimized the code for the 16-bit environment (the speed/space increase was amazing- twice the speed and half the code!). I did thisover a weekend and spent a couple days cleaning up the user interface andadding the "Randomize" command to keep you from getting too bored.    Anyway, to get on with it, I'd like to greatly thank Leo J. Scanlon andhis book "Apple IIgs Assembly Language Programming" without which I wouldstill be spinning my wheels.  I recommend this book highly to anyone whowants to learn machine-level programming for the GS.  His book fully exploresthe G, and touches as much as anybody knows on the S.RUNNING LIPHE------------Just open it up from the Finder, or it can be run from a Shell (ECP16, APW,etc) or a program selector (ProSEL16, etc.).  Since it's only 8K long, itshould load up pretty quick.  Once it does, the screen will be blank (exceptfor the cursor and menus).  So let's talk about the menus.USING LIPHE - THE MENUS=======================Apple Menu- The only thing under the Apple Menu is "About..." which just              basically tells the same stuff as at the end of this document.              Oh, and you can pull out your favorite desk accessories.              Note: there is a little incompatibility with DAs. They work              but if you move them while they're active, the system tells              Liphe to update its window, and it does- right over the desk              accessory.  Liphe writes directly to screen memory for              speed reasons.  So exercise caution when using DAs.File Menu----------    New       This choice simply clears the current Universe. Use caution              since New doesn't ask you to make sure you want to do this.    Load      This allows you to load a previously saved Liphe screen.  Only              binary files (BIN, $06) are displayed.    Save      Lets you save a Liphe screen.  Just type in the name to save              it under.  For convention's sake, you should end the filename              with a ".LIF" suffix, since it is unlikely that Apple would              grant us our own filetype.  The file is saved as a binary              (BIN, $06) file.  Don't be alarmed when not all the files              use the same number of blocks on the disk.  GS/OS automatically              sparse-ifies files written with it, a sort of compression              (actually, it just doesn't write blocks which are all zeros).    Quit      Quits Liphe and returns to launching program.Life Menu---------    Start     Starts the Liphe-processes going. Stop it by pressing the 'ESC'	key.    Randomize This randomizes the contents of the Universe, making about half              of the cells live and half dead.  This is mainly to keep you              from getting bored.   Right now there's no fancy stuff like the currently popular Life programLifeLike has (also- this program is free, LifeLike is $25 or so shareware).Soon I hope to implement stuff like on-the-fly mutation, painting with lifeobjects, and modification of the rules that govern the Life universe.USING LIPHE - EDITING THE SCREEN================================   To edit the universe, just point with the mouse and click the button. Ifthe cell was dead, it springs to life.  If the cell was alive, you shamelesslykill it :^).  Anyway, you'll notice after you start editing that there's anumber displayed at the bottom of the screen.  This is the current populationof the universe.   To draw a whole bunch of cells at once, just hold the mouse button downwhile dragging the mouse- it's just like a paint program. If the first pixelturns on, the rest turn on and the same goes if the first pixel turns off.Once you play for a bit it's easy to figure out (one of the nice things aboutthe Mac/GS interface).Colors------   Each cell has an "age", which is displayed as different colors.  Of course,a cell which is dead appears white.  Cells that were just created get gray,cells that have been around for a generation are red, and so on.  This featurejust adds some sparkle to the display, and really has no purpose right now.In the future I may design some totally new Life rules with age as the basisfor whether a neighbor cell lives or dies.TEXTLIFE========   Included in this little "package" is a special bonus. TEXTLIFE is thefirst 16-bit version of life I did for the GS.  The source no longer existsso it is a curiosity. But at better than twice as fast as Liphe-816, it'sa QUICK curiosity.  The only commands it supports are- Arrows to movecursor, RETURN to toggle the state of a cell, A (must be Capital A) to startLife, ESC to stop it, and Q (must be Capital Q) to exit.TEXTLIFE must be run from a shell as it cannot return to the finder.THE FUTURE==========  I'm sure as time goes by I'll be adding and updating Liphe-816, and when I doI'll let you all know.  I'm currently thinking of ways to make the calculationseven faster (they're highly inefficient right now...if I'm clever enough I canprobably double the speed again!).  Also, I'll be working on the stuff Imentioned above (students just don't have much time for this kind of stuff!).If you'd like to get ahold of me to make suggestions or gripe or whatever, myaddress is below (Unix/ARPAnet).  Thanx for trying out Liphe-816!!Jawaid Bazyarbazyar@netcom.com
